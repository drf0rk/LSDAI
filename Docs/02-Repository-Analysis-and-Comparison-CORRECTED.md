# LSDAI Repository Analysis: Comparative Framework for Phase 0 Development

## üìã **Document Purpose & Scope**

### **Analysis Objective:**
This document establishes the comparative analysis framework for the Phase 0 (Foundation & Design) comprehensive code passover, as defined in AGENTS.md. It provides the methodological approach for analyzing the three reference repositories to inform the Skeleton Development Plan and File Structure Design.

### **AGENTS.md Compliance Notice:**
This document serves as the analytical framework for Step 0.2: Comprehensive Code Passover. It does not contain analysis results, as no analysis has been performed yet. The project is currently stalled at Phase 0, awaiting environment verification before any analysis can begin.

- **Layout Design**: Widget organization and user experience

### **3. Model & LoRA Management**
- **Selection Mechanisms**: How models and LoRAs are presented and selected
- **Download Logic**: URL parsing and file download implementations
- **Validation**: Model integrity and compatibility checking
- **Organization**: How downloaded content is structured and managed

### **4. WebUI Launching**
- **Multi-WebUI Support**: How different WebUIs are handled (Forge, A1111, ComfyUI, Fooocus)
- **Installation Logic**: Dependency installation for each WebUI
- **Configuration**: WebUI-specific settings and optimizations

## üö´ **Out-of-Scope Analysis Areas**

### **Explicitly Excluded (Per AGENTS.md)**
- ‚ùå **Local PC Installation**: Cross-platform compatibility for Windows/macOS
- ‚ùå **Local Installers**: setup.sh, installer.py, or similar local installation scripts
- ‚ùå **Widget Builder Systems**: Visual GUI creation tools or "Photoshop for Custom GUI"
- ‚ùå **Desktop Applications**: Any functionality targeting local PC deployment
- ‚ùå **Platform-Specific Features**: Windows/macOS specific optimizations

### **Rationale for Exclusion**
> **AGENTS.md Source of Truth**: "The final product is explicitly designed to be cloud-native. It is intended to run in environments like Google Colab and Vast.ai, not as a local PC application. All development choices must serve this goal, and any code related to local PC installers is considered out-of-scope."

## üìù **Notes for Analysis Phase**

### **Important Considerations**
1. **This is NOT an analysis of existing work** - No implementation has been performed
2. **This is NOT a comparison of completed features** - The project has not produced any deliverables
3. **This is NOT a feature selection document** - Features will be determined during Skeleton Development Plan creation
4. **This IS a framework for future analysis** - Actual analysis will begin after environment verification

### **Analysis Principles**
- **Reality-Based**: All analysis must be based on actual repository contents, not hypothetical scenarios
- **Methodical**: Follow the established three-repository comparison process
- **Purpose-Driven**: All analysis must directly inform the Skeleton Development Plan
