# LSDAI Project: Context and Requirements

## üéØ **Core Mission**
**What is the fundamental objective or problem being solved?**
* The fundamental objective is a ground-up refactoring of a complex and unmanageable project into a **simple, robust, and maintainable single Jupyter Notebook**
* Primary goal: Create a cloud-native multi-WebUI launcher specifically designed for environments like Google Colab and Vast.ai
* Larger context: The project should support launching one of four WebUIs (Forge, A1111, ComfyUI, Fooocus) with interactive widgets for model/LoRA selection and a text-based "shopping cart" feature
* Immediate objective: Complete Phase 0 (Foundation & Design) analysis and planning before beginning cell-by-cell implementation

## üèóÔ∏è **Established Framework**
**What rules, constraints, methodologies, or definitions are we operating under?**

## üì¶ **Current Project Status & Deliverables**
* **Project Status**: In Phase 0 (Foundation & Design) - analysis and planning phase
* **Blocking Issues**: 
  - Development environment reliability needs to be confirmed
  - Environment verification (Step 0.1) must be completed before proceeding
  - No implementation work can begin until Phase 0 is completed
* **Phase 0 Deliverables (Pending)**:
  - Environment verification confirming all three reference repositories are accessible
  - Comprehensive code passover analysis of all three reference repositories
  - Skeleton development plan outlining cell-by-cell structure
  - Project file structure design with clean, modular architecture
* **No Generated Outputs**: No implementation has occurred, so no scripts, documentation, or artifacts have been generated

## üéØ **Critical Decisions & Reasoning**
* **Decision to Pivot to a "Clean Slate Rebuild"**: 
  - Reasoning: Direct feedback revealed that prior work was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the project's core goals (cloud deployment vs. local PC application)
  - Rationale: Abandoning previous documentation and plans was necessary to realign with the true project vision
* **Decision to Adopt a Methodical, Collaborative Workflow**: 
  - Reasoning: A prior, faster pace of execution was not aligned with the project owner's desire for deep collaboration and discussion at each step
  - Rationale: The new three-phase workflow with Greenlight Protocol ensures alignment and proper analysis
* **Decision to Prioritize a Stable Environment**: 
  - Reasoning: Core AI capabilities for interacting with the file system became unreliable, blocking development progress
  - Rationale: A reset was deemed the only viable path to unblock the development plan and ensure reliable environment for cell-by-cell implementation

## üöÄ **Immediate Next Steps & Development Strategy**
- **Priority 1 (Blocking)**: Complete environment verification to confirm all three reference repositories are accessible and stable
- **Priority 2**: Conduct comprehensive code passover analysis of all three reference repositories
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Cannot proceed to any implementation until environment is verified stable
  - Need reliable file system access and AI capabilities for analysis work
- **Decision Points**: 
  - Whether the development environment is sufficiently stable for methodical work
  - How to structure the comparative analysis framework for maximum effectiveness

### **Phase 2: Integration Review (After Each Cell)**
1. **Step 2.1: Post-Implementation Check**
   - Review state of entire project after each cell implementation
   - Ensure new cell integrates perfectly with previous components
   - Verify no new bugs introduced and simplicity/robustness maintained

2. **Step 2.2: Final Approval for the Cell**
   - Submit completed, integrated cell for final Greenlight
   - Mark successful completion of development cycle
   - Proceed to next cell in Skeleton Plan

## ‚ùì **Unresolved Elements**
* **Environment Stability**: The development environment reliability needs to be confirmed before any work can proceed
* **Reference Repository Access**: Must verify that all three required repositories are properly cloned and accessible
* **Comparative Analysis Framework**: Need to establish the specific methodology for analyzing and comparing the three reference repositories
* **Cell Structure Design**: The exact number and purpose of cells in the final notebook needs to be determined through analysis
* **File Structure Architecture**: The specific organization of backend modules, CSS, and JavaScript files needs to be designed
* **Why these remain unresolved**: The project is intentionally stalled at Phase 0 until environment verification is complete and proper analysis can be conducted
* **Considerations**: All unresolved elements will be addressed systematically through the Phase 0 analysis and planning process, with each decision requiring Greenlight Protocol approval

## üéØ **Next AI Activation Prompt**
You are continuing work on the LSDAI project following the authoritative AGENTS.md framework. Based on this corrected context document, your role is Development Analyst and Methodology Specialist.

Current context: The LSDAI project is in Phase 0 (Foundation & Design) and requires environment verification before proceeding. The project is a cloud-native multi-WebUI launcher for Google Colab and Vast.ai environments, following a strict three-phase cell-by-cell development methodology with Greenlight Protocol approval. All previous documentation and plans have been abandoned in favor of a "Clean Slate Rebuild" approach.

Immediate task: Begin Phase 0.1 by executing a command to list the contents of the `References/` directory to verify that all three required repositories (anxety-solo/sdAIgen, remphanstar/LSDAI, drf0rk/LSDAI) have been successfully cloned and are accessible. This is a blocking step - no further work can proceed until environment verification is complete.

Working constraints: Follow AGENTS.md as the authoritative source of truth, maintain cloud-native focus (local PC applications are out-of-scope), adhere to Greenlight Protocol for all decisions, and provide detailed analytical reasoning for all technical choices.

Please begin by executing the environment verification command and reporting the results. If successful, proceed to prepare for the comprehensive code passover analysis. If unsuccessful, report the specific issues preventing progress.
