# Advanced Strategy and Progress Tracking Techniques

## **Overview**
These techniques provide sophisticated strategies for complex decision-making, self-correction, and progress tracking throughout the LSDAI project lifecycle.

---

## **üöÄ Chain-of-Thought for Complex Decisions**

### **When to Use**
- When making complex architectural decisions or resolving technical trade-offs.

### **Prompt Template**
```
Let's think through this decision step by step:

1.  **PROBLEM ANALYSIS:** What is the core problem? What are the constraints?
2.  **REPOSITORY EVALUATION:**
    *   How does `anxety-solo/sdAIgen` handle this (the simple way)?
    *   What went wrong in `remphanstar/LSDAI`'s approach (the complex way)?
    *   Are there viable alternatives in `drf0rk/LSDAI`?
3.  **DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:**
    *   Cloud-native implications (VRAM, performance)?
    *   Integration complexity and maintenance burden?
4.  **DECISION SYNTHESIS:**
    *   What is the best approach balancing simplicity vs. features?
    *   What are the trade-offs? How does it comply with AGENTS.md?
5.  **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**
    *   What needs to be built? How will it be tested? What are the risks?

Now provide your final recommendation with full reasoning.
```

---

## **üöÄ Self-Correction and Quality Assurance**

### **When to Use**
- Before finalizing any technical work or deliverable for Greenlight review.

### **Prompt Template**
```
Before finalizing your response, perform a self-correction and quality check:

COMPLIANCE CHECK:
- ‚úÖ **AGENTS.md Methodology:** Does this follow the prescribed workflow (e.g., repository comparison, Greenlight protocol)?
- ‚úÖ **Cloud-Native Focus:** Are local PC considerations excluded? Is it optimized for Colab/Vast.ai?
- ‚úÖ **Avoids Over-engineering:** Does this learn the lesson from remphanstar/LSDAI and favor simplicity?

QUALITY CHECK:
- ‚úÖ **Clarity & Actionability:** Is the proposal clear, unambiguous, and implementable?
- ‚úÖ **Technical Soundness:** Is the approach technically feasible and robust?
- ‚úÖ **Completeness:** Does it address all requirements and edge cases?

CONSISTENCY CHECK:
- ‚úÖ **Architectural Alignment:** Does this fit with the "Notebook as Interface" and modular backend principles?
- ‚úÖ **Project Vision:** Does it support the overall goal of a simple, maintainable launcher?

If any check fails, identify the issue and revise your response before proceeding.
```

---

## **üöÄ Risk Management and Mitigation Planning**

### **When to Use**
- When planning complex implementation work or making high-impact technical decisions.

### **Prompt Template**
```
Develop a risk management plan for [PROJECT/COMPONENT]:

RISK IDENTIFICATION:
-   **Technical Risks:** e.g., "Dependency conflict in Colab's pre-installed libraries." (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)
-   **Development Risks:** e.g., "Parsing logic for model 'shopping cart' is more complex than anticipated." (Likelihood: High, Impact: Medium)

MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
-   For **Risk 1**: "Pre-emptively check for and uninstall conflicting library versions in a dedicated setup step."
-   For **Risk 2**: "Start with a simple parser for basic URLs, then use Progressive Enhancement to add more complex patterns."

MONITORING AND REPORTING:
-   Define how risks will be tracked (e.g., in status reports) and when they should be escalated.
```
